## About The Project

Ville de Cuisines is my submission to the [dev.to Appwrite Hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-appwrite-hackathon-on-dev-1oc0). I built it for my girlfriend and myself to make diet planning fun. I also added a few social components to make it more engaging.

Unfortunatly, I was not able to implement all the features during the time of the hackathon. I still hope you'll find it entertaining ðŸ¤

### Built With

* [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [AppWrite](https://appwrite.io/)
* [Github](https://github.com/)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
## Get started

### Quickstart

1. This app is built on top of a running Appwrite instance. Head over to the official website to quickly get your instance up and running.
2. Then install the [appwrite-cli](https://appwrite.io/docs/command-line) and deploy the `appwrite.json` - configuration.
3. You can now start the frontend application using `npm run dev`. It will open on `localhost:3000`.

### Demo

There's a demo version of Ville de Cuisines hosted on Netlify. You're very much invited to check it out and fiddle around a bit. If you find a bug, [please do open an issue](https://github.com/tq-bit/ville-de-cuisines/issues)

Since AppWrite's backend is hosted on a rather small VM, this demo comes with a few constraints:

- Max. upload size is 1mb
- Image loading can take a while
- The frontend service layer is not yet optimized and has no caching.
- Please be mindful when making http requests.
